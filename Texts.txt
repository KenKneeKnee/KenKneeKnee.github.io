Hello there! I am a currently an undergradute at Nanyang Techonology University in Singapore studying all things related to data
and computer science. The current languages under my belt include Python, R and front end web development kit (html, CSS,..) but 
I am always keen to add more!

In my spare time, I love to game, read, play chess and frustrate myself doing leetcode questions. Away from the desk, I also like to
run and hike. Come take a look at my previous undertakings!
