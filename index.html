          <p>
            Hello there! I am a currently an undergradute at Nanyang Techonology University in Singapore studying all things related to data 
            and computer science. The current languages under my belt include Python, R and front end web development kit (html, CSS,..) but 
            I am always keen to add more!
          </p>
          <p>
            In my spare time, I love to game, read, play chess and frustrate myself doing leetcode questions. Away from the desk, I also like to
            go for a run or hike. Come take a look at my previous undertakings!  
          </p>
